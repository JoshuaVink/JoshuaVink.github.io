                    <h2>Thomas Edison</h2>
                        <p>
                          Thomas Edison was born in 1847 and died in 1931. When he was still early in his career he operated a telegraph, which is known to have started his imagination on further that field. Thomas Edison made a lamp, also known as a lightbulb, that used relatively low current. He experimented with many different types of wire and found that copper was a very efficient wire for how much it costs. Later Thomas Edison founded his own electric lighting company, and it powered street lamps, some people’s houses, and some other things. A decent amount of time after that he started to get competition in the electricity field. Edison used direct current electricity, while most of his competitors switched to alternating current. Edison argued that alternating current was uncontrollable at higher voltages, but despite this, more people were using alternating current. As a result of this, Thomas Edison’s profits were going down. Although he was still making a living, his company was not near as big as it was before.
