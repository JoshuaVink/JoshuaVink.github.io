                <h2>Alessandro Volta</h2>
                    <p>
                      In the year 1800, Alessandro Volta invented the battery. This invention was made by alternating discs of Zinc and Silver to make what is called a voltaic pile. His father died when he was seven. Volta’s family wanted him to be a lawyer, but Volta wanted to be a scientist, being fascinated by the world around him. After he became a scientist, he found an idea that he thought was wrong. The idea that was wrong was made by Luigi Galvani and he thought that animals produced electricity to function. Volta’s determination to prove Galvani wrong lead to Volta’s discovery of the battery. Volta soon discovered that when he stacked up different materials of metal together it would produce electricity. Not soon after this amazing discovery of the battery, many other scientists discovered different ways to use and improve Volta’s invention.
