                    <h2>Industrial Revolution in Britian</h2>
                    <p>The Industrial revolution started in Britain because they had a lot of natural resources. Britain had natural harbors and rivers that could be used for transportation, water power, and construction of canals. They also had plentiful amounts of coal and iron which could be used to build and power the new machines. The Industrial Revolution was focused on their textile industry. They started out with the Cottage Industry. Companies distributed raw cotton to peasant families for them to thread and weave into cloth. The peasant would then deliver the cloth to skilled artisan for them to finish and dye the cloth. As new machines were invented that allowed for faster production of cloth, people began to gather together in factories to work. This increase of production created a need for faster and cheaper transportation. Canals were dug, turnpikes were created, and the steam locomotive was invented. The Industrial Revolution started a chain reaction in Britain. Inventors developed new machines, production increased, prices fell, and there was a higher demand for goods. This cycle created a wave of economic and social changes in Britain that greatly affected the way that people lived.</p>
