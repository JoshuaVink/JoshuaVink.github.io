                 <h2>Industrial Revolution</h2>
                 <p>The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing process in Europe and the United States. Which took place roughly between 1760 and 1840. With the invention of new machines it became easy to mass produce things. It allowed for farmers to grow enough for themselves and still have extra to sell. No longer did everyone have to grow their own food. Instead many people sold their farms and left to work in factories. Factories could produce goods much more efficiently than individual people could.
