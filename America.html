                 <h2>Industrial Revolution in Britain</h2>
                 <p>
                  The  Industrial Revolution in America was quite a while after Britain, but America was still able to catch up to Britain. This was due to the fact that America had much more natural resources than Britain. They also caught up to Britain quickly because they could copy them. America didn’t have to go through all the trial and error that Britain did. One example of this is the mill. America borrowed many of the ideas of Britain to use for their own, and since they were working for Britain, they worked for America. The American Revolution was very vital for the growth of the U.S., and it led to the making of many factories and even some industries. It led to the invention of the automobile and even improved long-range communication. This benefited America’s economy for the better.
