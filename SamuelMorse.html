                    <h2>Samuel Morse</h2>
                    <p>
                      Samuel Morse was a painter and an inventor that helped develop the Morse code and invented the telegraph. In 1825, Samuel Morse was painting portrait of Lafayette in Washington, DC. At this time, a man came delivering a message by horseback that his wife was healing from a sickness that she had. The next day, Morse received a letter that his wife was dead. He stopped working on the painting and left as soon as he could. He rushed to his home in New Haven, but by the time he had got there his wife was already buried. This motivated him to try and find a better way for long-range communication. He found a scientist that specializes in electromagnetism, and the idea of the telegraph was born. Morse then made a patent for his invention. This helped many people communicate over long distances. At the end of Samuel Morseâ€™s life, he gave large amounts of money away to charity. He died in 1874, having helped many people with his invention of the telegraph.
